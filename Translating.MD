# Translation process

1. Ask for the access rights to the Arabic fork on the [initial issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/book/issues/1415).
2. Choose a chapter to work on, from the ["Arabic Translation" Project Board](https://github.com/georgio/rust-book-AR/projects/2). Make sure that the original writers marked it as "frozen", and that the source is is up to date with the [original version](https://github.com/rust-lang/book).
3. Please create a branch in order to work on your translation.
4. Translate the chapter.
5. When you are satisfied with your translation, and want feedback/help on your work, please open a Pull Request.

When the PR is created, you can ask for a review from other contributors. You can also help by taking a look at the opened Pull Requests.
Please do not hesitate to comment or provide corrections wherever you find necessary.
